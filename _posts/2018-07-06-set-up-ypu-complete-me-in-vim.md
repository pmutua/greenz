It has several completion engines:

- an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,
- a Clang-based engine that provides native semantic code completion for - - - C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as "the C-family languages"),
- a Jedi-based completion engine for Python 2 and 3 (using the JediHTTP wrapper),
- an OmniSharp-based completion engine for C#,
- a combination of Gocode and Godef semantic engines for Go,
- a TSServer-based completion engine for TypeScript,
- a Tern-based completion engine for JavaScript,
- a racer-based completion engine for Rust,
- a jdt.ls-based experimental completion engine for Java.
- and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide - - semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).
