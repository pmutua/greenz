<p>Sometimes you will find yourself in a situation that you want to revert to the previous commit. In this tutorial I’m going to show you how to Undo a <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> and remove files staged for a git commit. It’s pretty much simple as shown below:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">git reset filename.txt</code></p>

<p>Will remove a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">filename.txt</code> from the current index, the “about to be committed” area, without changing anything else.</p>

<p>To undo <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add . </code> use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git reset</code>  (no dot).</p>
